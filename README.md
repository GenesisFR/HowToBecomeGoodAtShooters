## Introduction

I'm going to make a video series about how to become good at shooters because I've noticed a vast number of players don't spend the time to study how game mechanics work or learn from their mistakes. It doesn't take a genius to be a decent player so I'm just gonna lay things out there so that everyone can understand how games work and what it takes to become better.

I'll use this document to mention what I'm gonna talk about. I'll edit it when I think of new concepts or when I find new tricks. If you think of something that is not listed, feel free to message me (contact information at the bottom). Once the list is done, I'll start making videos about it. Don't expect any good editing, I don't know anything about it so I'll have to learn that on-the-fly and I don't deem it important for these videos.

While it's divided into 3 sections, the one about The Division 2 will be the first I will focus on.

## PVE concepts

### Aggro
- definition: when mobs target you
- how to use it to your advantage (bait for another player)
- how to get it off you (use utility/players, break line of sight, run away)
- do not direct it at other players
- only aggro one mob (RPGs only)

### AI animations
- predictable
- different in every game (must be studied)
- can be used for crosshair placement

### AI behavior
- predictable
- different in every game (must be studied)
- can be used for funnelling mobs and setting up traps

### Angle isolation
- definition: using the environment/utility to isolate enemies
- creates a series of 1v1s
- makes it easier to win engagements
- reference: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-LyLG5YieY

### Clearing angles
- be methodical, clear progressively and check every corner
- use jiggle peeking to quickly get information without allowing the AI to react
- reference: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivh8r0LxgLQ

### Crosshair placement
- aim at head level
- snap to the wall as you're clearing an angle
- reduces how much you have to move your mouse before being on your target
- reference: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U9mvXfnY8wU

### Damage indicator
- definition: UI elements indicating when the player is taking damage, where the damage is coming from and whether you're low HP or not (if the game has no health bar)
- allows you to quickly pinpoint where the attacker is
- allows you to decide whether to engage or take cover based on your HP
- reference: https://medium.com/@jasper.stephenson/a-ux-analysis-of-first-person-shooter-damage-indicators-59ac9d41caf8

### Difficulty
- always play on hardest
- forces you to be smart
- you learn more and faster about the game than on easier difficulties
- more rewarding

### Elevation
- vantage points allow you to have a good view of your surroundings and devise tactics
- in 3rd person shooters, you can see the enemies before they can see you (gets you information in pvp)
- usually offers more cover versus low ground being a no man's land
- can see enemies hiding behind low covers

### Environmental damage
- definition: using the environment to your advantage
- can kill/disrupt/bait enemies (explosive barrels, gas tanks, etc)
- can flush enemies out of cover

### Falling back
- always have a backup location before an engagement, if things were to go south
- prevents the AI from cornering you, thus putting more pressure on you

### Minimap/radar
- allows you to see incoming threats
- can reveal the location of various useful items (like ammo crates)

### Movement
- always move from cover to cover to minimize exposure and incoming damage
- always reload behind cover (unless the area is clear)
- breaking line of sight with the AI gives you time to recover or devise another strategy

### Peeking
- definition: show yourself to start an engagement or get information
- try to peek as far away from a corner (body less exposed)
- don't expose yourself for too long: peek, get the kill (or take the shot for sniper rifles) and hide
- can peek for longer or even switch targets if AI animations allow it (ex: AI stumbling when shot) and you know they're unlikely to hit you

### Perspective
- definition: how much of your body is seen by enemies
- the less of your body is exposed the further away you are from a wall
- reference: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5e8HZqF3cyk

### Playing your build/class
- every build has a purpose and must be played a certain way
- not playing your build for what it's supposed to do or not playing it correctly is inefficient

### Relocation
- definition: moving elsewhere unnoticed after being spotted
- when the AI pinpoints your location, it may put more pressure on that location
- relocating makes the AI lose track of you and allows you to take shots from another location
- reference: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1WF22xSEgU

### Starting engagements
- scout the area (enemy types, environmental damage, fallback location)
- prioritize your targets
- set up traps if the game allows it
- study AI routes if applicable (ex: Hitman)

### Sweeping
- definition: clearing an area from one side to the other, one enemy at a time
- allows you to keep track of which side enemies are at any given time
- when new enemies spawn in a cleared area, restart the sweep
- if your current enemy isn't peeking or is out of your line of sight, skip to the next one

### Target prioritization
- closest first: preferred strategy if no dangerous enemies are around
- dangerous first: allows you to have more freedom of movement
- weakest first: allows you to get rid of multiple enemies quickly, thus facing less enemies at the same time
- group first: same as weakest, except you'll take out multiple enemies without switching targets
- alone first: allows you to thin out enemies without raising the alarm

### Weak points
- different in every game (must be studied)
- allows you to kill/disrupt several enemies at once
- may prevent enemies from using their abilities

### Weapon recoil
- different in every game (must be learned)
- rule of thumb: shoot in bursts to maintain accuracy

### Weapon selection
- use the right weapon based on distance (short range: SMG, long range: sniper rifle)
- use specific weapons/ammunition if the AI is vulnerable to it

## PVP concepts

### Baiting
- using a teammate to force your opponent to peek, thus revealing his location and allowing you to get the kill without getting shot (baiting a teammate)
- forcing your opponents to use their utility by putting pressure or using utility against them (baiting utility)
- jiggle peek (see the "Jiggle peeking" section) to have an opponent reveal his location (baiting a shot)
- reference: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43J9nUmrbo4

### Callouts
- definition: feeding your teammates with information about enemy positions or your next move
- learn the map-specific callouts
- when making callouts, you must include location, count, health remaining, direction, weapon used and any essential information (ex: bomb holder in CS:GO)
- when requesting utility or revealing your intentions, make the callout beforehand to give your teammates time to adjust
- callouts must be fast to allow your teammates to react quickly
- they must also be concise to avoid covering game sound from your teammates
- no callouts from dead people

### Clearing angles
- same points as in pve
- you must know the map and where people are usually standing (gets you information and map control)
- reference: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivh8r0LxgLQ

### Crossfire
- definition: having multiple people at crossed angles so that their arcs of fire overlap
- allows you to focus your opponent from multiple angles
- forces your opponents to aim in multiple directions

### Double peeking
- definition: having 2 people peek an opponent at the same time
- creates a 2v1
- can be from the same angle (short + wide swing) or different angles
- relies on voice communication

### Flanking
- definition: attacking the enemy from a side while they're focused on another side
- make sure your teammates are focused by the enemy
- call out you're flanking so that your teammates keep fighting the enemies from the same location

### Focus management
- definition: splitting your attention between several locations
- prevents you from getting flanked
- allows you to maintain map control

### Getting information
- definition: knowing the enemy's location, count and destination
- always make callouts to let your teammates know about new information
- allows you to take rational decisions to give you the upper hand

### Holding angles
- active angle: randomly jiggle peek
- passive angle: be at an off-angle
- reference: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1ux6y4esvw

### Jiggle peeking
- definition: strafing left and right around a corner
- used to bait shots
- gets you information without taking (a lot of) damage
- reference: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJ1rCx8AEBc

### Lurking
- definition: playing sneaky, far away from your team
- aggressive lurker: puts pressure in an area to prevent enemy rotation
- passive lurker: doesn't show his presence, flanks rotators to maintain map control
- plays an important role in the end of rounds
- reference: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxGv0EJG4-Q

### Map control
- definition: taking control of contestable areas
- allows you to dictate the pace of the game
- helps you guess where the enemies are
- restrains the enemy team options
- reference: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3K2V3RMpFU and https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Tc_STmhZVc

### Off-angle
- definition: a spot where the enemy is not expecting you
- used to surprise your enemy, usually only works on a single opponent
- buys you some time to get the kill while your opponents adjusts his aim
- must be used sparingly otherwise your opponent will catch up
- reference: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nm5o26Cqi6U

### Rotating
- definition: moving from a part of the map to another, usually to play an objective
- on the attacking side, can be used to catch the enemy team off-guard (must sell a fake push beforehand)
- on the defending side, helps you slow down an enemy push

### Strength in numbers
- a 2v1 is better than a 1v1
- move like a pack or in pairs in order to trade kills

### Trading
- definition: killing someone who just killed a teammate
- only doable if moving in pairs, obviously
- allows you to maintain map control if you get the trade
- reference: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8YfVRuKk8_Y

## The Division 2

### AI animations
- dodge roll: done to avoid explosions (grenades, mortar, seekers) or after getting shot
- knockback: after inflicting a certain amount of damage, gives you time to line up your next shot or get the kill
- quick peek: done from cover on Heroic difficulty or lower by tank operators and medics, wait for it to get headshots with a (sniper) rifle
- strafe: used after spotting a player, take your time to adjust your crosshair when sniping/rifling
- status effects: see the section below

### AI behavior
- dictated by positioning and playstyle
- being aggressive makes them stay back or in cover
- being passive makes them go in the open and push
- legendary tanks tend to retreat after breaking their bag
- they always try to flank
- they become aggressive when you're low HP
- they try to melee you when you're in close range

### Black Tusks
\- reference: https://thedivision.fandom.com/wiki/Black_Tusk#Archetype

#### Assault
- fights from cover and moves cover to cover to avoid enemy fire
- equipped with EMP grenades
- no weak point

#### Controller
- controls a mini tank while staying in cover
- distracting him will cause the mini tank to stop functioning
- killing him will stop the mini tank from moving
- if the mini tank is damaged, he will attempt to repair it, making him vulnerable
- no weak point

#### Drone Operator
- deploys suicide drones above her that target players and skills
- destroying their backpack causes an explosion that hurts her and prevents her from deploying drones
- destroying the drone also causes an explosion that can kill her if she's close
- unable to deploy drones when disrupted
- usually peeks a few seconds after deploying drones if a player is visible (great for riflers/snipers)

#### Medic
- throws EMP jammers and attempts to revive downed allies via a medical drone
- destroying the drone forces him to run to downed allies to revive them
- elites throw jammers that strip away armor and health
- destroying the EMP jammer pouch sets off an EMP that disrupts him
- vulnerable when manually reviving downed allies (animation can be interrupted by dealing enough damage)

#### Mini-tank
- equipped with a machine gun and a grenade launcher
- rolls around slowly while the controller operates it from cover at medium range
- occasionally holds still and begins spinning a laser dazzler around in a circle, blinding any enemies caught by it
- both treads can be destroyed, making it stop moving and causing its controller to come repair it
- dealing enough damage to it will cause it to go back to its controller for repairs
- killing the controller will cause it to go haywire while looking for a target
- doesn't despawn until all other Black Tusk units in the fight are dead
- elites roll faster, have more health and fire incendiary grenades
- vulnerable to explosive damage

#### Rusher
- tries to get close to use his deadly shotgun
- ignores grenades and stinger hives
- elites will throw a flashbang grenade when getting close
- has the lowest amount of HP of all archetypes

#### Sniper
- takes cover at long range while attempting to eliminate targets and sets up decoy lenses that can be confused for her real position
- retreats if a player gets too close to her
- deploys a taser drone that seeks out hostiles and stuns them, granting her a clear shot
- destroying her lens pouch prevents her from deploying the countermeasures
- destroying the drone on her back prevents it from being deployed
- needs to acquire a target for a few seconds before shooting
- doesn't have as much HP as the other archetypes

#### Support
- places a support station down healing nearby allies and attempts to repair it when damaged (TODO: verify the repair bit)
- destroying the station on his back prevents him from deploying it
- elite support stations grant overheal to nearby allies
- support stations can be disrupted, temporarily stopping their healing ability
- if undestroyed at the end of combat, support stations grant an armor kit

#### Tank
- attempts to stay at range, using his minigun to suppress enemy targets
- has a support station mounted on his back which feeds a constant supply of health recovery
- his minigun ammo belt never requires a reload
- has no armor bar, but you have to destroy his armor plates before damaging his health
- resistant to explosives
- breaking his ammo belt forces him to reload
- destroying the support station stops his health regeneration
- destroying any weak point, any explosion or a bleed hive causes the ammo belt to reappear
- foaming him during the reload animation (up until he stands up after reloading) forces him to redo the entire reload animation
- using the SHD Demolisher Firefly will break the ammo belt, then the support station, then armor plates, depending on which one was previously broken
- the survivalist crossbow completely breaks his armor plate
- has no armor behind his support station

#### Thrower
- uses an airburst grenade launcher to hit targets behind cover
- shoots his grenades based on the last visible location of a player
- destroying the grenade pouch on his back causes an explosion that hurts him
- grenades can be destroyed when shot mid-air, causing an explosion
- elites fire their airburst launcher in volleys of 3 to make dodging harder
- unable to shoot grenades when disrupted

#### Warhounds
- heavily armored quadrupeds that attempt to position themselves with clear line of sight to enemies and use a powerful sniper type armament, a grenade launcher or a minigun to dispatch their foes
- have no armor bar, but you have to destroy their armor plate before damaging its health
- elites have the added bonus of firing on the move
- although warhounds don't have a head, shooting their red eye counts as a headshot, proccing headshot-related talents like Perpetuation (TODO: verify this information)
- their legs have a 90% damage reduction
- the survivalist crossbow completely breaks their armor plate (unless you aim for the legs)
- explosive damage and disruptive skills (jammer pulse, EMP sticky bomb and EMP grenade) bypasses their armor plating and does damage directly to their health
- critical hit damage and headhunter stacks on their legs isn't affected by the damage reduction and therefore bypasses their armor
- Hostile Negotiations from the Negotiator’s Dilemma gear set bypasses their armor
- Pestilence ticks bypasses their armor
- using a demolisher firefly while they're disrupted bypasses their armor
- the Firestarter shotgun (from the Firewall specialization) allows you to put them on fire by lowering their fire resistance
- 3 variants with different weak points, causing them to stop working for a few seconds when destroyed:
##### Sniper warhound
- has its weak point exposed in the form of a little red cartridge on the right of the gun when it fires (TODO: verify if still bugged for elites)
- elites fire in 3-round bursts with the sniper turret when stationary
- dealing enough damage to its legs staggers it and prevents it from firing (or at least delays its next shot)
- shooting its butt bypasses its armor
- when destroyed, creates an EMP explosion, disrupting agents in close range and everything else in medium range (TODO: check if the EMP range is bigger on elites)
##### Minigun warhound
- has weak points located at the top of its legs
- elites can stop and after a short charge up time, fire their minigun in a devastating 360° spin
- when destroyed, explodes with fragmentation inflicting damage and causing everything nearby to bleed
##### Grenadier warhound
- has weak points behind its cannon and at the top of its back (TODO: check for other weak points)
- elites fire 3 shock grenades in a salvo and try harder to flank
- when destroyed, explodes with an electrical charge, causing everything nearby to be shocked
- shooting the hinge next to its cannon bypasses armor

### Cleaners
\- reference: https://thedivision.fandom.com/wiki/Cleaners#Tom_Clancy.27s_The_Division_2

#### Assault
- equipped with a flamethrower
- shooting the fuel tank on his back will make him panic until it explodes (the explosion will stagger him)
- if his fuel tank is shot, it disables his ability to use his flamethrower

#### Controller
- deploys drones dropping vapor bombs over the target, causing it to burn
- has a weak point on his left thigh, where his cluster bombs are stored
- shooting the drone on his back will prevent him from deploying it
- shooting the bomb pouch of the drone will cause it to drop its load, setting fire to anyone caught in the blast
- after dropping its load, the drone goes back to the controller, making him stand up a bit to load it with bombs again

#### Engineer
- armed with an incendiary artillery turret
- his turret can ensnare and burn its targets
- if its target is hit, he will shoot at the ensnared target
- shooting the red spot on the turret will cause it to burn and ensnare everyone around it (TODO: verify if the turret is still operational afterwards)

- doesn't have as much HP as the other archetypes

#### Tank
- armed with a flamethrower and molotov cocktails
- shooting the fuel tank on his back will temporarily cripple him and make him remove his helmet, thus making him vulnerable to headshots
- shooting the gas tank on his left leg will disable his flamethrower and force him to use a fire axe
- shooting the bag on his right leg will disable his ability to throw molotov cocktails
- bounty tanks are armed with DC-62 grenades and do not have a fuel tank (TODO: verify this information)

#### Thrower
- armed with vapor grenades.
- throws grenades from cover then shoot the gas that emerges
- shooting the firestarter grenade satchel on the back of his waist will set him and everything around him on fire
- elites have a grenade launcher that fires napalm projectiles similar to the engineer's turret

### Cover to cover
- reduces enemy accuracy on you, thus drastically reducing incoming damage
- faster than running
- allows you to reload without reducing speed
- doesn't prevent explosions from hurting you or lowers explosion damage

### Dancing
- definition: moving across/around an NPC to force them to melee/chase you
- baits for your teammates to get the kill (weak point explosions can kill you)
- buys you time to relocate or get the kill before the NPC recovers from his animation
- best used when it's the last mob of a wave or an isolated mob

### Group composition (basics)
- definition: the different builds the group is made of
- you want the right balance of offense, defense and utility
- you should focus on offense first, then defense/utility
- skill selection for skill users depends on whether you're fighting Black Tusks (equip the jammer pulse) or not
- you want to create synergy between builds, some builds/skills don't work well together (ex: fire/blind with snipers)
- some examples of good synergy are 3 dps + 1 healer/cc, 3 afk skill builds and 1 skill support build

### Group composition (advanced)
- kill-dependency levels
   - 4: your life depends on it (ex: bloodsucker/hunter's fury frontliner)
   - 3: your effectiveness depends on it (ex: headhunter sniper)
   - 2: it helps but is not essential (ex: tech support skill user)
   - 1: it doesn't matter, (ex: medic)
- your team should have an average kill dependency <= 2.5

### Hyenas
\- reference: https://thedivision.fandom.com/wiki/Hyenas#Archetypes

#### Assault
- fights from cover and moves cover to cover to avoid enemy fire
- no weak point
 
#### Controller
- deploys remote-controlled explosive cars from behind cover
- elite RC cars set the area around the car's explosion on fire and confuse anyone within the blast radius (TODO: verify the confuse bit)
- destroying her backpack is an effective way to get rid of her (TODO: verify the confuse bit, if shooting the bag kills purples, how much HP left for elites and if she can deploy cars afterwards)
- shooting the RC car will cause it to burn and confuse everyone around it
 
#### Engineer
- sets up sniper turrets and attempts to repair them when they're damaged
- destroying his backpack will prevent him from deploying his turret
- damage a deployed turret to expose the engineer.
- elite turrets shocks its targets
 
#### Medic
- sprints to dead allies in an attempt to revive them with adrenaline and supports living allies with combat stims, granting them overheal
- destroying the red stripe on his bag prevents him from assisting allies

#### Rusher
- sprints towards targets and attempts to melee them with a baton
- has a destructible riot helmet that prevents headshots
- her spice bag is on her left hip and grants extra speed and damage to melee attacks (TODO: check if it grants overheal too)
- destroying her spice supply confuses her and everyone nearby, preventing her from using the drug
- elites are equipped with shock batons
- has the lowest amount of HP of all archetypes, so body shots usually take them down fast

#### Shield
- takes cover behind a massive riot shield while facing down his enemies with a sidearm

- a small window in the shield can be shot through (great for riflers/snipers)
- doesn't have as much HP as the other archetypes

#### Sniper
- stays in cover at long range

- elites have the ability to deploy shock mines, immobilizing anyone making contact with them
  
#### Tank
- relentlessly moves towards enemies, fearless behind a bulwark of heavy armor
- destroying his ammo belt forces him to manually reload his machinegun (TODO: check if his LMG even requires a reload)
- deploying a turret or a hive will make him immediately go to it and kick it to destroy it
 
#### Thrower
- fires a grenade launcher equipped with tear gas grenades from range
- destroying his ammo pouch on the back waist will cause an explosion, killing or damaging him
- elites fire multiple concussion grenades in succession

### Looting
- deconstructing gear set pieces grant blue materials
- looting is proximity based, so wait for others to be close before opening crates
- you can share any cache with whoever was in your group the moment you obtained (not opened) the cache

### Outcasts
\- reference: https://thedivision.fandom.com/wiki/Outcasts#Archetypes

#### Assault
- more aggressive than True Sons Assaults, who are more cautious
- smarter than Hyena Assaults and use cover more often
- elites are equipped with concussion grenades.
- no weak point
 
#### Controller
- utilizes an RC car equipped that will rush towards their target and attempt to cut them apart with its spinning saws
- when hit, its target will suffer constant heavy damage and bleed
- the RC car is heavily armored on the front and sides but has a weak spot on the rear
- it can be avoided with a dodge roll, which exposes its weak backside, and the saws can be destroyed, rendering the RC useless
- dodging also can make the car get stuck on a wall for a few seconds, making it immobile
 
#### Heavy Weapons
- provides suppressive fire with his LMG
- similar to True Sons' Heavy Weapons but they lack the armored helmet and ability to go prone
- destroying his ammo pack will make him flail as it goes off, but if he survives, he will switch to a pistol

#### Rusher
- runs at his target with the intent to blow himself up, taking out the enemy in the process
- his vest can be shot, causing him to explode prematurely, damaging friend and foe alike
- elites will set themselves on fire, adding a fire effect to their explosion similar to a Molotov
 
#### Scorcher
- utilizes homemade flamethrowers
- destroying the fuel tank she carries on her waist will make it explode after a few seconds, causing her to panic, sometimes rushing at her target, then causing heavy damage to her, sometimes even killing her
- after her fuel tank is destroyed, she will switch to a pistol
 
#### Sniper
- a long-range bowman unit that wields a bow with explosive arrows
- these arrows have travel time and the "sniper glare" is attached to them, making them easy to dodge
- when hitting a target, they cause heavy damage and staggers the target out of cover before exploding, causing even more damage and stagger
- when a bowman is drawing his bow, he can be interrupted, which will cause him to blow himself up with his own arrow
- his quiver can be blown up with a few well-placed shots, causing it to explode
- elites fire incendiary arrows that after exploding, cover the ground in fire for a short time
- elites use stolen SHD Tech Incinerator Turrets and place down incendiary ammo boxes (TODO: verify this info)

#### Support
- places down ammo boxes for his allies containing incendiary ammo that can be picked up by other Outcasts
- shooting a deployed ammo box will damage anything in a small area (TODO: verify if they can place multiple ammo boxes)
- shooting the ammo box on his back will make it explode and disable his ability to place down ammo boxes
- elites deploy shock ammo boxes, they usually drop special ammo upon death

#### Tank
- heavily-armored melee unit armed with a sledgehammer that walks towards his target, but will switch to sprinting if he gets close enough
- deals very high damage with each swing, but his attacks are slow and leave him vulnerable to counterattacks
- named Outcast Tanks are faster and do more damage per hit
- some named Tanks in Kenly College are armed with flamethrowers
 
#### Thrower
- throws Molotov cocktails that leave a patch of fire around an area for a while and will explode on impact, so evasive maneuvers must be taken while they are still in midair
- can be interrupted mid-throw causing him to drop their molotov at their feet and putting himself on fire
- shooting his red pouch on his right thigh will set him and everyone around on fire
- when shooting a Molotov out of the air, the fire will spread to the ground right under it, regardless of how high in the air it was 
- elites will throw incendiary grenades that detonate after a short fuse and a wider radius

### Playing ARs
- main attribute: health damage
- effective against anything that doesn't have an armor bar: red mobs, robotics and tanks
- pairs well with the crusader shield
- good way to use it is to burst targets down to trigger the knockback animation
- Negotiator's Dilemma is the best gear set for it

### Playing crowd control
- prevents the AI from shooting back or using their abilities
- Creeping Death is a must as it spreads status effects on hit
- Scorpio is a must as it's another form of CC
- Survivalist is a must for the additional damage to affected targets
- 2 types of CC builds:
#### Eclipse:
- good for Heroic content and CP4s, only useful in legendaries if your group focuses affected targets
- spreads status effects on kill
- preferred skills are riot foam/firestarter and airburst seeker/burn sticky bomb
- bigger cooldowns
#### High-end:
- great for legendaries, as long as you can manage your cooldowns (use Tag Team)
- preferred skills are blinder firefly and jammer pulse
- lower cooldowns
- CC'ed enemies must be within sight of your teammates to be efficient

### Playing LMGs
- secondary attribute: out of cover damage
- effective against out of cover targets (robotics and tanks are always out of cover)
- can suppress enemies in cover (must only be used to go for a flank and allow teammates to push or revive someone in the open)
- suppressed enemies will not peek and may blind fire, preventing most of your group from killing them

### Playing medic
- allows your teammates to sustain damage
- BTSU gloves and Sweet Dreams/Scorpio are a must
- Survivalist is a must for the multiplicative outgoing healing
- use the crossbow on tanks and warhounds
- preferred skills are reinforcer chem launcher and restorer hive
- stick with your group, monitor their health, avoid dying and manage your cooldowns by picking up your hive when not in use
- if a red/purple gets close or you see an opportunity to kill one, melee with Sweet Dreams (doesn't work against robotics)
- refresh skill cooldowns between engagements (or after one or more teammates used a reviver hive)
- your restorer hive must be within sight of your teammates to heal them, therefore, its placement is important
- may be useful to do preemptive heals with the chem launcher, especially for shield users (it heals their shield)
- reference: https://www.reddit.com/r/thedivision/comments/ko4ds5/please_try_a_healing_build/ghqvfx1

### Playing rifler
- secondary attributes: critical hit chance and damage
- effective against all types of mobs thanks to critical hits
- pairs well with the crusader shield, especially when using a scope
- should go for headshots to maximize damage and/or knock enemies back

### Playing offensive skill builds
- skill placement is important, try not to put it too close to you or a teammate as it will draw aggro
- Harmony/Test Subject and Capacitor are a must
- 2 types of offensive skill builds:
#### AFK
- typical combo is striker drone and assault/sniper turret
- good for taking aggro off you and your teammates
- not meant to deal lots of damage on its own (except when running several with an artificer hive)
- bad for quickly bursting down mobs and against groups
#### Explosive
- typical combo is mortar and explosive sticky bomb/cluster seekers
- Demolitionist is a must for the multiplicative explosive damage
- very good damage output
- good for clearing groups of enemies, spawn closets, flushing targets out of cover and against robotics
- bad against moving targets and tanks

### Playing sniper
- main attribute: headshot damage
- effective against targets that have a head and no helmet
- for stationary targets, put your crosshair on them, at head level (or where it's going to be), before peeking
- for moving targets, put your crosshair on their trajectory and take the shot when they come across it
- for Nemesis, don't use the cover system but charge from behind cover, jiggle peek to acquire your target, peek again to release the trigger then hide
- you can stand in the open to force a target behind cover to peek you (preferably exposing yourself only from that target), just release the trigger at head level when they peek
- peek, take the shot and immediately take cover to minimize incoming damage
- can one shot dogs with the headhunter buff by shooting their legs

### Playing tank
- main attribute: armor cores
- bulwark shield, artificer hive and Liberty (to heal the shield) are mandatory
- must be able to self-sustain incoming damage and not depend on anyone
- must draw aggro on you by shooting mobs, maintaining proximity and line of sight
- must force mobs out of cover
- must provide more survivability to the group
- must stay within range of your teammates
- pay close attention to your radar to avoid getting flanked
- reference: https://www.reddit.com/r/thedivision/comments/hr0gxr/how_to_take_a_beating_a_guide_to_shield_tanks and https://www.reddit.com/r/thedivision/comments/jg4brb/whats_the_point_of_tank_builds/g9op8nb

### Reviving
- always revive from or behind cover to avoid getting shot
- avoid reviving before making sure the area is clear and you're not gonna get rushed
- you should always provide cover to the one reviving by either killing, CC'ing, aggro'ing or suppressing mobs
- downed players must get near cover without blocking it for alive players and avoid crawling in the open otherwise it'll make things harder for the reviver if they die
- sometimes it's better to go through the rest of the engagement without reviving someone because it would make you at risk

### Rikers
\- reference: https://thedivision.fandom.com/wiki/Rikers#Tom_Clancy.27s_The_Division_2

#### Assault
- takes cover and is not that dangerous, but can be in larger numbers

- his HMG can be destroyed on his back, preventing him from deploying it
- if the player gets too close, or all Rikers in the area die, the HMG detonates
- elites have an HMG that fires explosive rounds at a slower pace but doesn't inflict bleed damage
 
#### Leader
- gives a buff in health to all Rikers in the area
- always equipped with two weapons, one for long-range and another for short-range
- killing the Leader will return all Rikers affected by their buff to their health before the buff, minus the damage that was inflicted to them

- chases the player for a long time while firing their SMGs
- elites move faster and do much more damage
- has the lowest amount of HP of all archetypes

#### Sniper
- has a circular riot shield that he crouches behind while shooting at long-range
- has a taser gun at close range that shocks the target, used if the player gets too close
- usually crouches, but the shield can be destroyed with enough concentrated fire
- if his shield is destroyed, he will seek cover and fire from that position
- doesn't have as much HP as the other archetypes 

#### Tank
- heavily armored Riker armed with a Dazzler rigged riot shield and a nail gun that does bleed damage on contact
- has an air tank weak point that if shot, will make him switch to a pistol
- his shield can be destroyed with enough concentrated fire and so can his dazzler lasers
- the dazzlers are arranged in an inverted triangle just beneath the window in the shield
- if the shield is destroyed, he will then use his Nail Gun
 
#### Thrower
- equipped with proximity nail bombs that can cause bleed damage upon detonation
- usually stays away in combat and throws nail bombs from a distance
- has a weak point on the back of her waist that causes explosive damage to her when destroyed

### Skills
\- reference: https://thedivision.fandom.com/wiki/Skills/Tom_Clancy%27s_The_Division_2

#### Chem Launcher
- a direct hit from a Reinforcer/Firestarter will cause minimal damage, but will also consume Headhunter stacks (even on a headshot) and benefit from them, thus allowing you to kill a mob with it
- penetrates cover (except the Riot Foam variant)
##### Firestarter
- double tapping the button will remotely detonate gas clouds
- initial damage and ticks affected by DTA
##### Oxidizer
- clouds can stack
- flushes mobs out of cover
- affected by DTA and OOCD
##### Reinforcer
- much more effective at healing allies than yourself because only allies benefit from the initial burst heal

#### Decoy
- used to pull aggro off you and your group
- can be meleed, shot or damaged by explosions
- should be deployed at elevated but visible positions (better if unreachable)
- its duration can be greatly extended with an artificer hive

#### Drone
##### Bombardier
- affected by DTA
##### Defender
- its damage reduction isn't additive with protection from elites
- its duration can be greatly extended with an artificer hive
##### Striker
- always targets the chest
- used to pull aggro off you and your group
- flushes mobs out of cover

#### Firefly
- double-tapping will throw it in the direction you're aiming and automatically target the nearest mob

- you can proc In-Sync by not targeting any mob with it (double-tap it)
##### Blinder
- has an area of effect and will blind multiple mobs if they're close to each other
##### Burster
- affected by DTA

##### Hive
- deploying it is a good way to proc In-Sync and Feedback Loop from the Hardwired gear set
- drone speed based on skill tier
##### Artificer
- doesn't need to be deployed to affect your other skill
- protects you and nearby allies from disruption when deployed (like any other deployed skill as long as you're within 5m and using Technician)
- heals nearby deployed shields while holstered (TODO: verify this information)
##### Stinger
- efficient against drones due to their low HP
- counts as explosive damage
- initial damage and ticks affected by DTA

#### Pulse
##### Banshee
- the longer you hold the button, the further the confuse wave will go
##### Jammer
- the longer you hold the button, the wider the disrupt radius will be
##### Scanner
- its effect duration is also affected by skill duration

#### Seeker Mine
- tanks will destroy them when targeted if they're not distracted
##### Airburst
- has the longest status effect damage and burn duration in the game
##### Cluster
- it's better to throw them near mobs than to deploy them at your feet otherwise they'll most likely dodge them
##### Explosive
- explosive damage and bleed ticks affected by DTA
##### Mender
- automatically targets nearby friendlies that require healing

#### Shield
- deploying it is a good way to proc In-Sync and Feedback Loop from the Hardwired gear set
- protects your armor from explosions if aimed towards the impact
- double tapping Escape or the Inventory button allows you to instantly unequip and reequip a shield to proc Vanguard instead of waiting for the 1s cooldown
- TODO: check if incoming repairs affects artificer hive skill repair https://www.reddit.com/r/thedivision/comments/lzwtbl/does_explosive_resistance_actually_reduce_the/gq58siv
##### Bulwark shield
- while behind cover, peeking from the left allows you to have only your hand sticking out, therefore minimizing exposure
##### Crusader/Firewall shield
- deploying it will automatically switch to a weapon that can be used with shields (secondary weapon otherwise)
- increases your character's hitbox and therefore makes it harder to navigate through doorways and around props
- using a weapon with a scope will shift the camera to the right, allowing you to shoot from cover when peeking from the left
##### Deflector shield
- deflected damage scales with skill damage

#### Sticky Bomb
- applies status effect on impact
- double tapping the button will quickly shoot them (can be done from cover)
- explodes on impact when hitting drones
- not detonating a Burn/EMP sticky on a target will automatically reapply the corresponding status effect upon expiration if the status effect duration is less than the skill duration (like on legendary elites (except robotics) and Heroic named)
- you can proc In-Sync by shooting it at the sky (double-tap it)

#### Trap
- good to hold choke points
- cooldown starts as soon as deploying them
##### Shock
- deploys in a rough circular area, can shock friendlies (TODO: wasn't this fixed?)

##### Sniper
- targets the chest by default
- you have to ADS with your gun to switch to manual aim, which allows you to land a headshot, which deals more damage
- doesn't scale with headshot damage

### Status effects
- AI status effect resistance is based on difficulty, veterancy and skill used
- Bleed: mobs run away from the bleed source, robotics are immune (not to the stinger hive damage though)
- Blind: mobs wander around in random directions with an arm covering their eyes (hard to get headshots), robotics are immune
- Burn: mobs wander around in random directions, robotics are immune
- Confuse: mobs kneel down then wander around in random directions, robotics are immune
- Disrupt: red/purple mobs on Heroic difficulty or lower kneel down, effective against electronics, prevents mobs from using their abilities (except hunters), deployed support stations from healing and legendary tanks from using their backpack
- Ensnare: mobs can't move, any action they were performing will be interrupted, they will shoot at you if you're facing them (in a 180° forward angle), robotics are immune
- Poison: red mobs kneel down, robotics are immune (TODO: test on purples and Heroic-)
- Pulse: mobs are highlighted along with their weak points (even through walls) for a short time then stay tagged, it's not considered as a status effect and therefore doesn't proc status effect talents (except Spotter)
- raid bosses are immune to some status effects
- Shock: mobs kneel down for the duration of the shock, robotics can still move but are unable to use their abilities
- status effects cannot be refreshed, you have to wait until one ends before being able to apply the same one again

### Summit
- completing objectives early limits the number of additional enemy waves
- Contagion from the Eclipse Protocol gear set can destroy at least 2 waves of drones if one spawns shortly after the previous one
- foaming a hunter stops him from medkitting
- going down or dying on an objective keeps capturing it
- hunters stand up when deploying most of their skills, giving you time to land a few shots
- hunters will still be able to melee you when performing cover to cover or running past them, you have to roll to avoid being hit (they also seem to have a 2m melee range)
- killing marked targets with Negotiator’s Dilemma counts as skill kills (useful for the Cool Skills Challenge)
- the immune reviver drone can be disrupted but also destroyed by Hostile Negotiations from the Negotiator’s Dilemma gear set even though no icons will be displayed above the drone
- try to leave 1 or 2 mobs alive so you can complete objectives early (reinforcements don't spawn until clearing most mobs in a wave)
- wait for your teammates before entering a room to allow them to get ready and prevent objectives from triggering early
- when capturing objectives, don't peek unless you have to, completing objectives is more important than clearing mobs
- when no mobs are in a room, it's a drone ambush
- when stuck between a door and a wall, fast travel to another player
- you can open locked doors by shooting the lock with a chem launcher, it allows you to not alert enemies

### Talents

### Tips/tricks
- armor on kill (including Preservation) works with skill kills
- avoid sharing items near loot piles as it's common for someone to deconstruct a whole pile
- crossbow bolts apply localized damage, for instance headshots remove helmets
- double-clicking a cache instantly opens it
- Finisher can be proc'ed by destroying enemy skills
- Ground Control from the Future Initiative gear set is applied when someone has full armor, not when the FI user has full armor
- health doesn't regen when disrupted
- mobs can block shots and take damage from another mob, turning a mob right in front of you as a bullet shield
- opening an ammo box will automatically reload your current weapon
- Pestilence ticks affected by weapon damage, OOCD, DTA and DTH
- shooting the foam on an ensnared teammate or hip-firing at your feet breaks it
- skill damage boosts deflector shield damage (making Percussive Maintenance BiS)
- swapping any armor piece while out of combat restores all of your armor
- swapping to a loadout with a different specialization refills grenades
- swapping to another weapon after a reload is halfway done will still reload the weapon
- swapping to your pistol then to your other primary is faster than swapping between primaries
- the Chatterbox buff doesn't expire when wiping (as long as you don't switch weapons)
- the Cool Skills directive doesn't affect deployed skills
- the flamethrower's stream bypasses warhounds' health, it's not efficient on higher difficulties though as it requires burning a lot of fuel to kill a single one of them
- the Scavenged Skills directive can be bypassed with the Rigger backpack
- the survivalist medkit acts as a sphere, just like the Jammer pulse, so you can heal people above/below you
- Vile ticks are affected by Perpetuation, OOCD, DTA and DTH
- when medkitting with the fragile armor directive, use Perfectly Efficient
- when reviving a downed teammate, you can use them as bullet shield
- when your health is depleted, you have a 1-2s buffer to take cover before going down, it's disabled until you're back to full health, which takes around 30s without taking damage (TODO: test the cooldown duration)
- you can donate resources from the Projects tab on your map
- you can instantly decon all items marked for junk if you hold TAB while moving the mouse or press SHIFT + TAB
- you can kill enemies stuck behind doors with the Oxidizer
- you can refresh the golden bullet by deconstructing a skill or not targeting any mob with it (ex: firefly)
- you can skip real-time cutscenes by dodge rolling or aiming

\- reference: https://thedivision.fandom.com/wiki/White_Tusk#Archetypes

#### Drone Operator
- same as the Black Tusk [variant](#drone-operator), except the speed and health of the suicide drones are increased, they're deployed more often and instantly distance themselves from the operator to prevent collateral damage
- distance speed is affected by veterancy

#### Mini-tank
- same as the Black Tusk [variant](#mini-tank), except it can still target you after killing its controller and elites don't fire incendiary grenades

#### Rusher
- same as the Black Tusk [variant](#rusher), except he throws shock grenades

#### Sniper
- same as the Black Tusk [variant](#sniper), except she only needs 2s to acquire a target before shooting

#### Tank
- same as the Black Tusk [variant](#tank), except the support station is replaced with a variant of the SHD Stinger Hive which deals heavy damage to those within 15m and causes them to bleed
- tries to get close because of his stinger hive
- the stinger hive temporarily stops working when he's disrupted (TODO: check if it's the same when shocked)

#### Thrower
- same as the Black Tusk [variant](#thrower), except he always fires his airburst launcher in volleys of 3
- the time between grenade shots is affected by veterancy
